## CBC

### Description

A book club that’s about more than books. Personal goal tracking, meeting calendars, reporting metrics, a chat feed, and much more\!

### Introductory Blog Post

2 years ago some friends and I wanted to start a book club, but we wanted it to be about more than just the books.

We decided on a rotation of 3 themes, one for personal development/business, fiction/creative works, and philosophy/religion. This rotation has kept members with different interests engaged month after month, and the focus on discussion brings those members voices into conversations they might have otherwise missed.

Keeping on the theme of this being a personal development club, we've been tracking quarterly goals and habits and (as I'm sure you'd expect from any accountability group) seeing some huge progress towards huge goals.
