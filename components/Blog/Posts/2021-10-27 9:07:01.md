# Learn My Muse

## The Idea

There are many music teachers where I live in Utah, but there is no great option for finding them. A site with information on local instructors with the ability to filter by distance, price, and skill level would be very valuable. This will be supported by some light advertisements and eventually teachers can pay to be promoted.

## Scope

We will need a database of records for users with a value to denote if a user is also an instructor. An array of instruments played with a skill level for each and array of instruments taught with a skill range. If users teach they will have a boolean to determine if they offer in studio, or in house lessons. If both we will save in studio and for in house we will have a field for zip and range willing to travel. All users will have a zip code and a "range", a number denoting miles willing to be travelled to take lessons. Users will have a one to many relationship with reviews. Reviews will have user foreign key, review, and rating (1-5).

## The Stack

I will be using firebase for the hosting, firestore for the database, react for the frontend, Material-UI for the UI, and Mapbox for the map component.

# RPG Party Game

## The Idea

I would love to have an RPG game that functions similar to the Jackbox games. A host device will cast the main game to the tv (a map with the players, buildings, monsters, and items of interest) and all the players will have player sheets on their phones. By voting, the group will be lead through various stories where they take turns in combat to and puzzles.

## Scope

A host device (Browser to start, eventually consoles) will load the game and open sockets for users to connect to. All players will then open browsers on their mobile devices and enter a code displayed on the host device. Once connected, the first player can start the game. Once started all players will have a chance to create a player (eventually, load a saved character) as the host generates a unique world to be explored. The generated map will be static size for now, but eventually once saving is implemented the map can be any size with the ability to cross to new maps creating a unique "world". Dungeons will be introduced before saving and will be treating as a single alternate map in the game world.

## The Stack

I will be using firebase for hosting and firestore for the database. I will use React and custom CSS to create the UI. I am using React as this project will be mostly browser based, only the host device will eventually be ported to consoles.

# HTMElephant

## The Idea

HTMElephant is a collection of developer educational materials, mainly focused on full-stack web development. This idea came as I was helping friend after friend learn to code after going through a dev bootcamp myself. Through hackathons, simple lessons, and easy projects we will teach people the basics of web development.

## The Plan

I would like to involve my friend Matt as he was an instructor at a coding bootcamp and has great experience in this field. Currently hackathons are free and I'm giving free lessons as I create a few sample courses. Eventually we will be able to charge for the coding lessons (maybe a per project instead of the usual per course payment method?) and the hackathons will be sponsored.

# Monument games/pcs

## The idea

There are very few dedicated PC parts shops in Utah. As PC gaming is on the rise with the younger generations it would be great to have a place to provide the materials to build PCs, as well teach
